# learning how to use github
1. Create a new repository on the github through the default nagivator 
2. Then copy the url and input the following code on the terminal 
3. git clone Desktop/https://github.com/pzit0/botany563-NHA7-phylogenetic-analysis.git 

So far this has created a usable repository on both github server and my local computer 
By writing this here, I am changing the README.md file on my local computer 
I am guessing that I will then learn how to update the version on the server
