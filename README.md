Folder dedicated to the class Botany564 on spring 2023. I will be analyzing the NHA family in e. affinis and other species

# learning how to use github
Create a new repository on the github through the default nagivator 
Then copy the url and input the following code on the terminal 

$ git clone Desktop/https://github.com/pzit0/botany563-NHA7-phylogenetic-analysis.git 

So far this has created a usable repository on both github server and my local computer 
By writing this here, I am changing the README.md file on my local computer 
I am guessing that I will then learn how to update the version on the server

Yes, these are the three secret commands: 
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "updated readme" 
$ git push
